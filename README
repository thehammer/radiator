Radiator
========
Radiator is a Ruby on Rails application that exposes a web service for radiating information to devices like the Betabrite Prism.

Getting Started
===============
0. In order for Radiator to do anything interesting, you'll need a Betabrite Prism USB LED sign.  Plug it in.


Install Everything
====================

Debian:
  sudo apt-get install ruby
  sudo apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
  sudo apt-get install postgresql-server postgresql-client
  sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
  sudo apt-get install libusb-dev
  Make sure you have Rubygems 1.3.7 installed (use the one from rubygems.org NOT the Debian one)

Mac:
  Install MacPorts
  sudo port install ruby (MacPorts Ruby is much better)
  sudo port install postgresql
  sudo port install libusb-legacy (compat?)
  Make sure you have RubyGems 1.3.7 or later

Set up the Database
===================

  createdb radiator_production
  createuser radiator -P (use "radiator" as the password)

Setup Project
===================

  sudo gem install bundler
  bundle install 

Run Migrations
===================

  sudo rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

Running It
====================

  sudo ./radiator  (need sudo access for the USB)
  Go to http://localhost:8374/admin for the Typus interface.

Device Compatibility
====================
This version currently supports the Adaptive Technologies BETABrite Prism USB sign.  In theory it should work with any other Adaptive Technologies USB LED sign that supports the Alpha protocol.
