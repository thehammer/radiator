Radiator
========
Radiator is a Ruby on Rails application that exposes a web service for radiating information to devices like the Betabrite Prism.

Getting Started
===============
0. In order for Radiator to do anything interesting, you'll need a Betabrite Prism USB LED sign.  Plug it in.

1. Before using Radiator for the first time, you'll need to have libusb installed.  Source can be found at http://libusb.sourceforge.net, along with instructions for building it on your platform.  Binary distributions can also be found for certain platforms.  (For Mac OS, see http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/)

WS: On Debian, type "sudo apt-get install libusb"
WS: On MacOS, type "sudo port install libusb-legacy" (or libusb-compat?) (you will need MacPorts installed)

2. With libusb installed, execute 'sudo script/install_usb' from the base directory of the Radiator application.  This will build and install the ruby-usb native library.

WS: Does not appear to work.  You may need to go and add it manually.
WS: You will also need to type "bundle install" to build all the libraries.  
WS: If you have a dependency on Nokogiri, you will need "sudo apt-get install libxslt libxml2-dev"

3. Launch the service with './radiator' from the base directory of the application.  It will use port 8374 by default.

4. Start radiating.  You can test the service by going to http://localhost:8374/ and entering text.

DISABLED 5. Radiator includes a notifier builder_plugin for cruisecontrol.rb.  Just copy app/plugins/radiator_notifier.rb to the builder_plugins/installed directory of your cruisecontrol.rb installation, configure your projects as described in the notifier, and restart cruise.

WS: Moving this out for a more robust plugin mechanism, based off what Typo does.

Device Compatibility
====================
This version currently supports the Adaptive Technologies BETABrite Prism USB sign.  In theory it should work with any other Adaptive Technologies USB LED sign that supports the Alpha protocol.
